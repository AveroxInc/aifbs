# aifbs
The repository contains the implementation of Accumulative Interest Forwarding and B-Structure Content-Store Architecture for NDN, called AIFBS in short. The implementation is done on the top of ndnSIM 2.3, which is an ns-3 based simulator developed for the sole purpose of NDN experimentation.
